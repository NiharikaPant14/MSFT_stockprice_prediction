# 📈 Stock Price Prediction with TensorFlow and LSTM

Welcome to the **Stock Price Prediction** project! This repository contains a model built to predict **Microsoft stock prices** using **TensorFlow** and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for time-series forecasting.

## 🧐 Overview

The goal of this project is to forecast stock prices based on historical data using deep learning techniques. By leveraging Microsoft stock data, the model predicts future trends, assisting traders and investors in making informed decisions.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Keras**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Numpy**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Google Collab**

## 📦 Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```
## 🧠 Model Architecture

The **LSTM model** is trained on historical stock data to predict future prices. Here’s how the model works:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean historical stock data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract technical indicators and relevant features.
3. **LSTM Model**: Implement LSTM layers along with Dropout and Dense layers to prevent overfitting.
4. **Evaluation**: The model’s performance is evaluated on a separate test set.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone this repo and install dependencies.
2. Download the dataset and upload it in google collab. The dataset contains Microsoft stock prices.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is **Microsoft stock price data**. I’ve included the exact dataset in the repository so you can directly use it for training or experimenting with the model.

## 📈 Results

The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**. The predicted stock prices are compared with actual prices through graphical plots to visualize the accuracy.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Integrating additional technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) for better accuracy.
- Experimenting with other deep learning architectures like **GRU** and **Transformer**.
- Deploying the model as a **web app** or **API** for real-time stock predictions.
